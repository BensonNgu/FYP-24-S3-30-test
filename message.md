### **GitHub Project Workflow Tutorial**

1. **Cloning the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
   ```
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   git checkout -b feature-login
   ```
   - Create and switch to a new branch for your feature or changes.

3. **Switch Between Branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   git checkout feature-login
   ```
   - Use this to switch between branches in your project.

4. **Check the Status of Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - View any files that have been modified, added, or deleted.

5. **Stage Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .                 # Add all changes
   git add message.md         # Add specific files
   git add file1.txt file2.js # Add multiple specific files
   ```
   - Stage your files to be included in the next commit.

6. **Commit the Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Commit message explaining changes"
   ```
   - Commit your staged changes with a message describing what youâ€™ve done.

7. **Push Your Branch for Review**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   git push origin feature-login
   ```
   - Push your changes to the remote repository for review.

8. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to the GitHub website and create a **Pull Request** for your branch.
   - Review the **diffs**, add comments, and collaborate with team members on the PR page.
   - Look for features like viewing changes, adding comments, and requesting reviews.

### **Special Condition: Others Have Pushed Changes to the `main` Branch**

If other team members have pushed updates to the `main` branch, your local `main` branch might be outdated. Here's how to update your local branch and merge changes:

1. **Switch to the `main` Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   - Switch to your local `main` branch.

2. **Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   - Update your local `main` branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.

3. **Switch Back to Your Working Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-login
   ```
   - Switch back to your branch (e.g., `feature-login`).

4. **Merge `main` into Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```
   - Merge the latest changes from `main` into your working branch.

   - Resolve any conflicts, if necessary, then stage and commit those changes.

**Summary**: This tutorial helps you and your team manage a GitHub project smoothly using branches, commits, and pull requests, ensuring everyone works with the latest version of the project.
